# CS5500 Final Team Project

The team project has three parts -- __proposal__, __implementation__, and __presentation__. Each of the sections is described below. Pay attention to the due dates and deliverables for each section.

## Project Proposal

### Due Date

**Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 11:59 PM**

### Things To Do

1. Define at least three distinct features you want to implement to extend the fake stack overflow app. In the past, students have added the following features. You can use these features for ideas but are not limited to them. Feel free to use your imagination to develop the proposed feature set.
    - User authentication, tracking, and logging.
    - Creating and managing user profiles.
    - Post moderation.
    - Automatic tagging of posts.
    - Commenting and voting on posts.
    - Improve the user interface using Material UI.
    - Rating posts and accepting posts.
    - A system to help users earn badges and reputation points.
    - Allowing users with similar interests and values to create communities.

2. For each feature, define the requirements as user stories. At the very least each feature should have a user story. There is no limit on the number of user stories.

3. Each user story must be defined as an issue in GitHub and have the following format similar to the assignment on reddit user stories:
    ```
        Feature: feature name
        Context: The socio-historical context for the proposed feature
        Description: As a `user` I want to `action` so that I can `goal`
        Scenarios: Acceptance criteria defined as `Given When Then` scenarios.
    ```
    The `goal` of the feature description must accurately reflect the values you want to embed into the design of your application. 

    The acceptance criteria must describe both valid cases and error cases for full credit.
    
    The user stories should represent the minimal viable product (MVP). An MVP is a basic version of a product that can be released for feedback. You can go beyond the defined user stories in the final project. However, you will be graded based on the user stories you define in the proposal. Minor changes to user stories will be allowed in the final submission.

### Deliverables

1. A list of issues in this repository's issues tab.
2. The link to this repository in the Canvas assignment for project proposal.

### Grading

1. You will get full credit if your proposed features are approved. 
2. You will get no credit if your proposal is rejected.
3. Reasons for proposal rejection:
    - Failure to define three distinct requirements.
    - Failure to record requirements as GitHub issues.
    - Failure to comply with the given format.
    - The stories do not accurately reflect the values or goals.
    - The stories do not mention the stakeholders.
